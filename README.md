Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) the hard way: an implementation of a generative adversarial network (GAN) from first principles. 

A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning systems invented by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. I find it fascinating, so in order to understand it better I dedided to implement one without using any ML libraries. I do however use ML libraries for testing and providing datasets.

## Usage

To install dependencies:
```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r test_requirements.txt

```

To run the tests:
```
pytest
```
