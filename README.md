# gan
An implementation of a generative adversarial network (GAN) from first principles


A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning systems invented by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. I find it fascinating, so in order to understand it better I dedided to implement one without using any ML libraries.
